## Project: Binary Classification Of Bank Term Deposit

Used Logistic Regression and XGBoost models to predict whether a client would subscribe to a term deposit with a bank using a dataset with 750,000 training examples from Kaggle.

Utilized the Python Libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, XGBoost) for Data preprocessing, Model selection and Training, Model Evaluation and Data Visualization. Used RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of XGBClassifier.

Used Performance Metrics such as Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision and Recall. Achieved an 93.5% accuracy on CV set.
Acheived a score of 96.72% on test/submission set

Some Notable Details:

- Datasets: Train and Test files in data.zip, Test results in submission.csv
- Dependencies: requirements.txt
